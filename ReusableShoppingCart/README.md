# Reusable Shopping Cart

You’ll see here that we have three components in our shopping cart app. We’ve italicized the data each component represents.

1. **Nav Bar (Greyed Box):** Container for Title & "Cart" button
2. **Product List (Bordered Box):** Displays the entire *list* of the products available within the store. 
3. **Cart (blue):** List the item present in the *cart* with total amount along with "remove" icon.
